# DATA 558 Polished Code Release

Part of the DATA 558 - Statistical Machine Learning for Data Scientists course submission.

## About the model
In this model, I have implemented a kernel support vector machine with huberized hinge loss for multiclass classification. This remo has files which you can run on sample and actual datasets, see the performance of the model and compare it to scikit-learn's functions.

Considering multiclass classification as the main objective, all comparisons will be made with respect to a one-vs-all strategy. One of the best resources to read about this strategy can be found [here](http://www.mit.edu/~9.520/spring09/Classes/multiclass.pdf){:target="_blank"}
