# DATA 558 Polished Code Release

Part of the DATA 558 - Statistical Machine Learning for Data Scientists course submission.

## About the model
In this model, I have implemented a linear support vector machine with huberized hinge loss for multiclass classification. This remp has files which show  a demo on you sample and actual datasets, and compare it to scikit-learn's functions.

Considering multiclass classification as the main objective, all comparisons will be made with respect to a one-vs-one strategy
